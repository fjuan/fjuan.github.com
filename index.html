      <p>I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. Since 2009 I've been working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" >Ruby on Rails</a> and many other technologies to build websites and applications. Currently I'm developing myself as an Engineer Manager, after some years of working experience on my own company and as a freelance developer as well.</p>
      <p>In my free time I host a cooking blog called <a href="http://www.recetasdemama.es">Recetas de Mam√°</a> (Mom's recipes) that has become one of the most popular recipe sites on Spain. Since 2007 we've published around 1000 recipes and three cooking books!</p>

      <p>Using Ruby I've had the opportunity to participate in a wide range of projects: from working with the <a href="http://www.ohwr.org">CERN</a> to building a financial calculator for energy related commodities or use <a href="http://planetcassandra.org/">Cassandra</a> and <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> for processing cybersecurity related information.</p>
      <h3>My latest project: building a global Customer Support at Klarna</h3>
      <p>I joined Klarna in February 2015 to build the customer support web interface. We were a team of three developers plus a designer. Our task was to develop an application to fetch and merge information from several microservices and then present available actions to the Customer Support advisor.</p>
      <h3>The stack</h3>
      <p>The tool is split into a Ruby on Rails REST API plus a Javascript frontend built with <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember, a framework for creating ambitious web applications">Ember</a>. Before the end of 2015 we included in our stack an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" title="Elasticsearch | Search &amp; Analyze Data in Real Time">Elasticsearch</a> cluster in order to speed up the search of customers information.</p>
      <p>Both Ruby and Javascript codebases have a thorough test coverage at different levels (unit, functional, integration) and are deployed following the principles of Continuos Integration and Continuos Delivery. While our test suits requires around 6 minutes to run, we improved our deployment pipeline to be able to release a new version in less than a minute after the test suite is verified. In total, it takes 8 minutes since the pull request is merged until the new code is in production and this has enabled us to release an average of 25 times per week.</p>
      <h3>The numbers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong>: 10M documents, aprox 10Gb of data (by March 2016).</li>
        <li><strong>Test suit</strong>: 99,7% coverage, 6 minutes to run.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployments</strong>: &lt; 2 minutes to production. Average of 25 times per week.</li>
        <li><strong>Uptime</strong>: 100% during working hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The story</h3>
      <p>I moved from Cordoba to Madrid and my mother wrote me a cookbook with simple and delicious recipes. As I couldn't afford to loose it, I published those recipes to <a href="http://recetasdemama.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a>. Some months later, she started writing as well and we decided to move to a new address: <a href="http://www.recetasdemama.es">recetasdemama.es</a>.</p>
      <p>Today we're also publishing videos and we have nearly 500.000 followers across different social networks. During this time, we've published three books and had partnerships with amazing brands, like Pyrex, Moulinex and Microsoft!</p>
      <h3>The numbers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recipes</strong>: 12-15 each month since April 2007.</li>
        <li><strong>Comments</strong>: 40 new comments per recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Visits</strong>: +350.000 unique visitors per month.</li>
        <li>Countless <strong>Friends &amp; Fun</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The technology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WordPress</strong>: great publishing platform that we've customized with our own theme and several plugins.</li>
        <li><strong>Apache</strong>: my preferred web server.</li>
        <li><strong>Varnish Cache</strong>: mandatory piece for improving speed and optimizing resources on the server side.</li>
        <li><strong>Nikon D3001</strong>: for taking pictures and videos.</li>
      </ul>
